emma butterworth is a graphic designer, videographer, illustrator, painter, muralist, amateur filmmaker, image maker, wannabe wordsmith + comedien, and just generally a creative-type individual who lives and works in richmond, virginia.
alongside her constant exploration of these various mediums, emma is full-time student in virginia commonwealth university's graphic design program and does freelance design, illustration, and videography for "read to them", a children's literacy nonprofit.
informing her work is a desire to make immersive, emotional, impactful design and films. emma wants to produce worldview-altering works that take people's breath away--or at the very least linger with them for a moment.
she don't take herself too seriously, and neither does her work, despite caring enormously. overall, emma would like to make work that actually does something.
