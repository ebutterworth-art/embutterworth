<div class="content" style="text-align: left; top: 100px; width: 550px; left:9%;">
Richmond-based freelance graphic designer & videographer & illustrator (currently with Read to Them), painter, amateur filmmaker, image maker, full-time VCU student.
I really want to make immersive, emotional, impactful design and films.
I'd like to take people's breath away, or at the very least make them say "huh" (like a thoughtful "huh", not a questioning "huh").
I don't take myself too seriously, and neither does my work, though I care a lot.
I'd like to make work that actually does something.

Feel free to reach out if you're interested in my design, videography, or painting services.
