Hi! I'm a graphic designer, videographer, illustrator, painter, muralist, amateur filmmaker, image maker, wannabe wordsmith + comedien, and just generally a creative-type individual who lives and works in Richmond, Virginia.
Since graduating, I've been building my own small business and brand, searching and applying for jobs, and doing freelance design, illustration, and videography for Read to Them, a children's literacy nonprofit.
I'm a uniquely determined, empathetic, and conscientious person and these characteristics are fundamental to my creative practice. When I set myself to something, I make it happen. I pride myself in my efforts to master a number of areas, as well as constantly learn from my peers and surroundings. My goals in pursuing a career in design are twofold: to create a bridge between modern-day design and art history and other artforms/media, and to produce work that prioritizes the individual and the human experience. I'm available to discuss job opportunities, collaborations, and possible commissions (branding, logos, painting, prints, videography, photography, and more!).
